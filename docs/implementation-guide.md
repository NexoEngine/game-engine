# Implementation Guide: Advanced Game Engine Milestone

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the Advanced Game Engine milestone issues.

## Quick Start

1. **Create the Milestone**
   - Go to GitHub > Issues > Milestones
   - Create new milestone: "Advanced game engine"
   - Set description: "Major improvements to the editor user experience, asset management, physics integration, and development tools"
   - Set due date (recommended: 16-26 weeks from start)

2. **Create Issues from Templates**
   - Use the templates from `github-issues-templates.md`
   - Copy each template and create a new issue
   - Assign to the "Advanced game engine" milestone
   - Add appropriate labels and assignees

3. **Set Up Project Board** (Optional but Recommended)
   - Create GitHub Project Board for milestone tracking
   - Add columns: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done
   - Link all milestone issues to the project

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Editor Functionality (Weeks 1-12)
**High Priority Issues - Must Complete First**

1. **Issue #4: Add Component Button** (2-3 weeks)
   - Start here as it's foundational for other editor features
   - Required for physics component inspector

2. **Issue #1: Asset Import Parameters** (3-4 weeks)
   - Critical for asset workflow
   - Foundation for other asset manager features

3. **Issue #3: Right-Click Context Menu** (2-3 weeks)
   - Can start after basic asset operations exist
   - Improves user workflow significantly

4. **Issue #5: Physics Component Inspector** (3-4 weeks)
   - Depends on component addition system
   - Critical for physics workflow

5. **Issue #9: Comprehensive Undo/Redo** (4-6 weeks)
   - Complex but affects all editor operations
   - Should be implemented early to avoid retrofitting

6. **Issue #7: Game Scene Simulation Mode** (6-8 weeks)
   - Most complex feature
   - Can be started in parallel with other features

### Phase 2: Enhancements and Quality (Weeks 13-22)
**Medium Priority Issues**

7. **Issue #2: Model Thumbnail Previews** (2-3 weeks)
   - Enhances asset manager UX
   - Can be done in parallel with other features

8. **Issue #8: Asset Manager Search** (1-2 weeks)
   - Quick win for user experience
   - Should be done after asset manager improvements

9. **Issue #6: Custom Collider Creation** (4-6 weeks)
   - Complex physics feature
   - Can be done in parallel with other development

10. **Issue #10: Scripts/Shaders as Assets** (3-5 weeks)
    - Significant refactoring required
    - Should coordinate with asset system changes

11. **Issue #11: SonarCloud Issues** (Ongoing, 2-4 weeks)
    - Can be done in parallel with feature development
    - Should be assigned to multiple developers

12. **Issue #12: Test Coverage Improvement** (Ongoing, 3-5 weeks)
    - Continuous effort alongside feature development
    - Should be assigned to multiple developers

### Phase 3: Documentation and Process (Weeks 23-26)
**Low Priority Issues**

13. **Issue #13: Manual Testing Documentation** (2-4 weeks)
    - Should be done after major features are complete
    - Can be done in parallel with final testing

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing project coding standards
- All new features must include unit tests
- Update documentation for public APIs
- Use existing UI/UX patterns where possible

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functionality
- Integration tests for complex features
- Manual testing for UI features
- Performance testing for rendering features

### Review Process
- All PRs require code review
- Large features should have design review first
- UI changes should include screenshots
- Breaking changes require team discussion

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Team Size and Skills
- **2-3 Senior Developers**: Core editor features, simulation mode
- **2-3 Frontend Developers**: UI features, asset manager improvements
- **1-2 Physics Developers**: Physics inspector, custom colliders
- **1-2 QA Engineers**: Testing improvements, manual test documentation
- **1 DevOps Engineer**: CI/CD improvements, SonarCloud issues

### Technology Stack
- **Editor UI**: Existing UI framework (likely ImGui based on codebase)
- **Asset Management**: Current asset pipeline system
- **Physics**: Physics engine integration (likely Jolt based on issues)
- **Testing**: Current testing framework (likely Google Test)
- **CI/CD**: Current pipeline with SonarCloud integration

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Game Scene Simulation Mode**: Most complex feature, may require significant refactoring
2. **Comprehensive Undo/Redo**: Affects all systems, risk of introducing bugs
3. **Asset System Refactoring**: Scripts/shaders conversion may impact existing workflows

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start high-risk items early
- Create proof-of-concept implementations first
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Implement comprehensive testing for risky changes
- Have rollback plans for major refactors

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All issues completed and closed
- Code coverage >80% for new features
- SonarCloud quality gate passing
- No performance regressions in editor
- All existing tests continue to pass

### User Experience Metrics
- Editor workflow efficiency improved (measured via user studies)
- Asset import/management time reduced
- Physics setup time reduced
- User satisfaction surveys positive

### Quality Metrics
- Reduced bug reports for editor features
- Faster onboarding for new team members
- Improved code maintainability scores

## Communication Plan

### Regular Updates
- Weekly milestone progress reports
- Bi-weekly team sync meetings
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Quarterly milestone reviews

### Documentation
- Keep issue descriptions updated with progress
- Document architecture decisions
- Maintain user-facing documentation
- Create developer onboarding materials

## Conclusion

This milestone represents a significant investment in editor quality and user experience. Success depends on:
- Proper prioritization and phasing
- Strong coordination between team members
- Continuous testing and quality assurance
- Regular communication and progress tracking

The estimated 16-26 week timeline allows for thorough implementation and testing of all features while maintaining code quality standards.
