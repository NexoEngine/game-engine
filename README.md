# NEXO Engine

ðŸ‘‹â€‹ Welcome to the NEXO Engine repository! This project is a collaborative effort to create a revolutionnary game engine. Our goal is to provide a robust, user-friendly, and efficient platform for game development in desktop as well as in virtual reality! ðŸ¤©âœ¨â€‹ðŸš€â€‹

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still in development and is not yet ready for production use. Some features may change.

## External Dependencies

To run this project, ensure you have the following:
- **CMake**: Necessary for building the project from source. (version 3.28 or higher) [install here](https://cmake.org/download/)
- **C++ Compiler**: We recommend using GCC or Clang for Linux and MacOS, and MSVC for Windows.
- **Git**: For cloning with submodules. [install here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- **.NET SDK 9.0**: Required for the C# scripting support. [install here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/dotnet/9.0)

## Build the project

Cloning and building is a breeze:

### 1. Clone the repository with the submodules.
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NexoEngine/game-engine.git NEXO-Engine
cd NEXO-Engine
```

### 2. Run cmake to generate the build files.

#### Option1: Using `CMake presets` (automatic) [Recommended]

```bash
cmake --workflow --preset=build-debug
```

> [!NOTE]
> There are several presets available: `build-debug`, `build-release`, `build-coverage`, `minimal-build`, `test-debug`, and `test-coverage`.

#### Option2: Using `CMake Build` (manual)

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

### 3. Launch the engine!

#### For Linux and MacOS:
```bash
./build/nexoEditor
```

#### For Windows:
```bash
./build/nexoEditor.exe
```

> [!NOTE]
> For detailed instructions, visit our [Installation Guide](docs/install/README.md).

## Install NEXO Engine

### Install via CMake

First build the project as seen in the step [Build the project](#build-the-project).
Then run the following command:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install
```

This will install the NEXO Engine in the directory `/path/to/install` with all the necessary files.

#### Create an installer for Windows (NSIS)

> [!WARNING]
> We assume here that you already ran the cmake command to generate the build files in the `build` directory.

To create an installer for Windows, you can use the [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Main_Page) installer.

1. First install [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download) on your computer.

2. Execute the following commands:
```bash
cd build
cpack -G NSIS -C Debug
```

Now you can run the generated installer to install the NEXO Engine on your computer.
```bash
./nexoEditor.exe
```

#### Create an installer for Linux (DEB)

> [!WARNING]
> We assume here that you already ran the cmake command to generate the build files in the `build` directory.

```bash
cd build
cpack -G DEB
```

To install the generated package (on Ubuntu/Debian...), run the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i NEXO-Engine-*-Linux.deb
```

## Run the tests

In this project tests use the [gtest](http://google.github.io/googletest/) library.

First build the tests:
```bash
cmake -B build -DNEXO_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build
```

Then run the tests:
```bash
cd build
ctest -C Debug
```

### How to extract the third-party licenses file

You can use the cmake install command:
```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install --component generate-licenses
```

This will extract all licenses per third-party library in the `/path/to/install/external/licenses` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> These licenses are automatically extracted from vcpkg, there might be missing third-party libraries.

### How to generate the COPYRIGHT file

You can use the cmake install command:
```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /path/to/install --component generate-copyright
```

This will generate the COPYRIGHT file in the `/path/to/install` directory.

> [!WARNING]
> By default the COPYRIGHT file is generated with some `TODO:`, the generator cannot always determine exact licenses for some files. Please check each entry for errors.
